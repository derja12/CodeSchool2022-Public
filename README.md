## Git/Github Help

This video is a great explanation of how I set up my _Github personal access token to automatically work_ with my wsl (ubuntu 20.04):

**If you are on windows and don't have wsl setup**, I recommend following along with this video to get a wsl set up (again, I use ubuntu 20.04 from the microsoft store): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-DHaQLrBi8 <br> Try and get a little familiar with some of the <a href="https://www.unixtutorial.org/basic-unix-commands">basic unix commands</a> (I recommend looking at ```cd```, ```ls```, ```rm```, ```mv```, ```cp```, and ```cat```). <br>You can set up a link to a given directory (ie. _your windows desktop_) by running the ```ln -s``` command Curtis Larsen explains on <a href="https://cit.dixie.edu/faculty/larsen/windows-editor-bash-compiler.php">this page</a>.
<br><br>
**If you're using macOS or Linux already**, you can use your normal terminal to run the Git CLI commands.
